Sopme coding guidelines


don't use any references to effects names in sequencing scripts. use general purpose scripts or interfaces/subclasses -> use inspector interface to reference and sequence different prefabs.

scripting conventions 
    case and naming
         - no undercores between words in names (no snake_case)
         - _underscore at start of private fields names.
         - variable names camelCase
         - method names PascalCase 
         - no abbreviations in names        
              
    keeping it clean         
         - don't leave commented or unused code in (use stashes or commit to a separate branch)
         - keep scripts uneder 350 lines
         - keep methods under 150 lines
         - don't repeat yourself
         - put bracket on next line for if or on same line if short enough
         - private / public fields/methods
         - use regions? or at least order
