Arthur :
	- elastic breathing out. Progress should be visible.
	- No rating - what's the sequence then?
	- The snow slowing interactivity should start at the beginning of each exhale (not after 2 seconds) and be tied to exhale linearly.

	- fog is moving a lot might be denser even if breathing out. less random noise? higher harmonics?
	
	- create a non-breathing-related equivalent to the snow scene (the same background and interactivity and progression) where the subject passively goes through the scene and the changes they experience are not related to their breathing. 
	
	- create an out-of-VR on-2D-screen-instructed scenario: a circle on the screen whose size getting bigger instructs the subject to inhale, and whose size getting smaller instructs the subject to exhale. In the exhale phase, for the first 3 seconds the color of the circle is c1, for the next 4 seconds the color is c2, and after 7 seconds the color is c3, to instruct the optimum length of exhale is between 3 and 7 seconds. 


	- add transition from full fog to max fog at the beginning of the psychedelic scene
	- also do the transition when back from the psychedelic scene 
 	- build the entire control scene. Add video player. decide on the interaction
 	- make everything work in one scene?
 	- force exact number of digitd
 	- do editor trick to fix avpro inverted video problem and get maps to align perfectly everytime
 	- UI position different in control scene, closer
 	- optimize trails effect 
 	
Done :
 	- make sun rise/sun set scenarios
 	- jump in particles speed from between snow and music and snow slowing phases 
 	- popup hidden behind hole
 	- fog blocks no breathing popup
	- comprsesion on the garden music. make birds approximately 20% lower 
	- make snow (no breathing), snow with breathing, sauerkraut.
	- snow intervention becomes main intervention
	- add a popup warning if no breathing using a timer.
	- when the control scene is selected, don't show the instructions video 
	- make sure passthrough is included 
	- for the first 5 minutes, progressively, synced with the hole sound, fade in the natural soundtrack of the environment. 
	- add Snow scene music to the hole scene, coming in after 2 minutes (5 minutes?), progressing with breathing and staying until the end
	- make controller vibrate during the instruction video
	- from scenario to post-rating, do an audio and visual fade. what kind of transition?
	- jittery and unreadable text from panels too far away.
	- more saturation on the beach, a bit of hue shift
	- disable vibration at beginning of scene
	- Drones stopping abruplty
	- northern light fades out too fast
	- staircase progress for garden and night sky
	- progressive max of aurora. should only be visible after 2nd or 3rd breath of progress
	- more wintery sound for snow sceneario. less birds


Have controller vibrate in waiting scene?
about sound in hole scene
lower max overlay opacitty

need optimizing garden video
