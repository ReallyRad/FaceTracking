	All Scenarios : 
	- remove mipmap on static images 
	- create a different music progression system? add audio effects over time? move to different sections? 


	NightSky :
	- find a background sound.
	- line at the stitches on the 360
	- wind sounds, birds chirping as base background sound, no more water sound
	- transition too fast. fading to white happens too fast.

	Garden :
	- make 3 phases work in build (Music wasn't progressing properly)
	- use background sound from video OR get video to work
	- find/make new music

	Data Collection :
	- Recover CSV writing setup I made for another project

	Snow scenario :
	- look for ambient music stems 	
	- find ambien sounds for the snow scenario
	- Find background sound?

	Garden : 
	- improve garden image quality with topaz AI (called GardenFirstFrame in the project)

Who ?
	All Scenarios :
	- fog ends up blocking up too much of the field of view and interferes with reward
	- make an elastic "punishment" after long exhale "reward" to improve the perceptual relation between breathing and fog progress
	- try applying elasticity to another fog parameter rather than density 	
	- Bigger fog, denser, so nothing is visible at the beginning
	- No wind
	
	Beach : 
	- make a scenario with 3 phases and just saturation
