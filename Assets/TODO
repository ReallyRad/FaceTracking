	- staircase progress for garden and night sky
	- play with auroras color
	- progressive max of aurora. should only be visible after 2nd or 3rd breath of progress
	- comprsesion on the garden music. make birds approximately 20% lower
	- more saturation on the beach, a bit of hue shift
	- think about sequencing of elements (scenes, UI) in  
	- create some animations for skipping through UI elements


Mehdi : 
	- more wintery sound for snow sceneario. less birds
	- denser fog in garden.
	- play with the ray example to make the canvas waiting and the questions panel responsive


- make a panel with a video player
- make an audio player for the voice instructions
- Add a panel to let the experimenter chose the scene that they will be shown?? So that only one build can be done
- disable vibration at beginning of scene

Script for including practice into builds:

Show panel where the user inputs the user ID

THEN

Passthrough mode
1. Panel (2 questions rate)
2. Panel (2 questions rate)

THEN

(IF BEFORE SCENE)
3. Panel: Info:

Play video: 
AI: voice over: 
- "Now follow the person in the video breathing in and out. If you do this, you will feel the controller vibrating along as you breath out." 
- After a few rounds: "when exhaling, form your mouth as you would blow out the candle."

THEN
