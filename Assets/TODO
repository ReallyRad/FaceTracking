- post processing more explicit and bright
- more psychedelic breathing textures. 
- line at the stitches on the 360
- wind sounds, birds chirping as base background sound, no more water sound
- less strong northern lights 20%
- transition too fast. fading to white happens too fast.
- beach too dark
- Pp: more explicit, bright

Mehdi
- image quality of the new 360 scene. Improve it with topaz or other software
- fog ends up blocking up too much of the field of view and interferes with reward
- Don't apply wind to fog anymore
- try applying elasticity to another fog parameter rather than density 	
- no more particles
