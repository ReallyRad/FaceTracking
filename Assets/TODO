Arthur :
	- elastic breathing out. Progress should be visible.
	
	- The snow slowing interactivity should start at the beginning of each exhale (not after 2 seconds) and be tied to exhale linearly.

	- fog is moving a lot might be denser even if breathing out. less random noise? higher harmonics?

    - VR-Mystical (SnowAuto): find a simple way to simulate the breathing? Or make the sequence unfold by itself? Create new Scene 

	- VR Breathing mystical (Snow) : should be mostly there, but check the timing is OK.

	- Non-VR-Breathing scenario (NoVR): a circle on the screen whose size getting bigger instructs the subject to inhale, and whose size getting smaller instructs the subject to exhale. In the exhale phase, for the first 3 seconds the color of the circle is c1, for the next 4 seconds the color is c2, and after 7 seconds the color is c3, to instruct the optimum length of exhale is between 3 and 7 seconds. example animation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0QiLqPKoZg

	- VR-Control (Control) : why update video? Remove UI?

	- No more data collection at all? 	 	
 	
 	
Done :
 	- make sun rise/sun set scenarios
 	- jump in particles speed from between snow and music and snow slowing phases 
 	- popup hidden behind hole
 	- fog blocks no breathing popup
	- comprsesion on the garden music. make birds approximately 20% lower 
	- make snow (no breathing), snow with breathing, sauerkraut.
	- snow intervention becomes main intervention
	- add a popup warning if no breathing using a timer.
	- when the control scene is selected, don't show the instructions video 
	- make sure passthrough is included 
	- for the first 5 minutes, progressively, synced with the hole sound, fade in the natural soundtrack of the environment. 
	- add Snow scene music to the hole scene, coming in after 2 minutes (5 minutes?), progressing with breathing and staying until the end
	- make controller vibrate during the instruction video
	- from scenario to post-rating, do an audio and visual fade. what kind of transition?
	- jittery and unreadable text from panels too far away.
	- more saturation on the beach, a bit of hue shift
	- disable vibration at beginning of scene
	- Drones stopping abruplty
	- northern light fades out too fast
	- staircase progress for garden and night sky
	- progressive max of aurora. should only be visible after 2nd or 3rd breath of progress
	- more wintery sound for snow sceneario. less birds

Backlog :  	
 	- make everything work in one scene?
 	- do editor trick to fix avpro inverted video problem and get maps to align perfectly everytime
 	- UI position different in control scene, closer
	- need optimizing garden video
	- - build the entire control scene. Add video player. decide on the interaction
