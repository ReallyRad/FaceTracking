- more psychedelic breathing textures. 
- line at the stitches on the 360
- wind sounds, birds chirping as base background sound, no more water sound
- transition too fast. fading to white happens too fast.

- make a psychedelic garden
- adobe stock find 8k 360 material for psychedelic scene 	
- reduce motion sickness in beach
- trippy overlay texture on garden not on floor to avoid motion sickness 

- csv logging questionnaires ask mehdi
- ID input panel 
- remove mipmap on static images 
- look for ambient music stems for the snow scenario
- add audio effects over time? move to different sections? 

Mehdi
- find ambien sounds for the snow scenario
- fog ends up blocking up too much of the field of view and interferes with reward
- Don't apply wind to fog anymore
- try applying elasticity to another fog parameter rather than density 	
- no more particles
