Arthur :
- more intense interactive post processing. narrower band 
- lower volume of the shimmer.
new environment 
- spacey sound : EPIC. more upbeat music. Use harps? Cellos? orchestral sounds (2001)
- pass some of the tracks (all?) through tape to make the sound warmer.
- work out the stereo phase happening between the first two tracks
- add a second scenario with the same phases (fog / music / post processing)
- interactive aura on third phase 

Pick up a new scenario from ESA (Fabian)

work out transition from 1st to second scenario : 
- fade out first music
- use bloom to transition to new scenario
- fade out post processing of the first phase


Mehdi :
Fog > more happening in the beginning : 
- we need the user to immediatlely perceive the reward of their actions
"reward / punish" bring more fog when inhaling : do a bounce back of the fog effect with leantween with fixed duration and quadratic ease out as soon as .

interactivity : blowing away sth
- try to change wind direction and / or speed of the fog (follow the direction of the head)
- try particles coming out of your mouth when breathing out.

- make the reverb more present
