Arthur :
	- snow intervention becomes main intervention
	- make snow (no breathing), snow with breathing, sauerkraut.
	- fog is moving a lot might be denser even if breathing out. less random noise? higher harmonics?
	- comprsesion on the garden music. make birds approximately 20% lower
	- add transition from full fog to max fog at the beginning of the psychedelic scene
	- also do the transition when back from the psychedelic scene 
 	- build the entire control scene. Add video player. decide on the interaction
 	- make sun rise/sun set scenarios
 	- make everything work in one scene?
 	- fog blocks no breathing popup

Backlog : 
	- add a popup warning if no breathing using a timer.
	- when the control scene is selected, don't show the instructions video 
	- make sure passthrough is included 
	- for the first 5 minutes, progressively, synced with the hole sound, fade in the natural soundtrack of the environment. 
	- add Snow scene music to the hole scene, coming in after 2 minutes (5 minutes?), progressing with breathing and staying until the end
	- make controller vibrate during the instruction video
	- from scenario to post-rating, do an audio and visual fade. what kind of transition?
	- jittery and unreadable text from panels too far away.
	- more saturation on the beach, a bit of hue shift
	- disable vibration at beginning of scene
	- Drones stopping abruplty
	- northern light fades out too fast
	- staircase progress for garden and night sky
	- progressive max of aurora. should only be visible after 2nd or 3rd breath of progress
	- more wintery sound for snow sceneario. less birds


Have controller vibrate in waiting scene?
