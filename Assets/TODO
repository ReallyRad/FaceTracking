Arthur
- tweak fog quality that's adapted mobile VR performance (talk with dev)
 use mixer tracks to control audio volume instead of audio source
- 1 out breath for each audio track
- slow down fog
- talk to Nan about video hosting?

Mehdi
- meet with Fabian to tweak the post processing
- adjust the perceptual fog mapping so that the fading out is perceivable at all stages
- fog lifting over 7 exhales
- try linear for the exhale (fog and music)

Mehdi's Comments:
- for FogDisappearingControl, the number we assign to CompletedProgressAt does not
  not correspond with the number of complete exhales it takes for the fog to disappear.
  For example, when I put 3, it takes 5 full exhales for fog to disappear.
- for FogDisappearingControl, I assigned a parabolic curve onto progress. I think, now,
  there is a more uniform distribution of perceivable fog disappearing throughout.
- Fabian couldn't be here today (Friday), so, we set up a meeting to work on
  postprocessing on Monday afternoon 2:30.
- TrackingUI is now on the right GameObject.
