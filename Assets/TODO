- Add a panel to let the experimenter chose the scene that they will be shown?? So that only one build can be done
- disable vibration at beginning of scene


Play video: 
AI: voice over: 
- "Now follow the person in the video breathing in and out. If you do this, you will feel the controller vibrating along as you breath out." 
- After a few rounds: "when exhaling, form your mouth as you would blow out the candle."
