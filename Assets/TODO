TODO :
exponential with max
duration at max performance.

Do not give feedback on breathe in but track

audio mappping continuous progressive 

auditory vs visual
continuous vs discrete
progressive vs interactive

10 times of a 3 to 7 seconds 

8 tracks, 8 times of a 3 to 7 seconds

find curve for :
 - perception mapping
 - accelerated response increase

use timeline?
use sequine? https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/sequine-sequencing-animation-and-visual-scripting-260083

don't use any references to effects names in sequencing scripts. use general purpose scripts or interfaces/subclasses -> use inspector interface to reference and sequence different prefabs.



use more fine grained control of animation -> modify already existing animations of assets 

scripting conventions 
    case and naming
         - no undercores between words in names (no snake_case)
         - underscore at start of private fields names.
         - variable names camelCase
         - method names PascalCase 
         - no abbreviations in names        
              
    keeping it clean         
         - don't leave commented or unused code in (use stashes or commit to a separate branch)
         - keep scripts uneder 350 lines
         - keep methods under 150 lines
         - don't repeat yourself
         - put bracket on next line for if or on same line if short enough
          - private / public fields/methods
          - use regions? or at least order


ammbisonics
reward with saturation and extra sparkly sounds once everything has been faded in

phase 1 fog
phase 2 music
phase 3 color (music still on)

volumetric lighting
    
play around with threshold to have it work without smile
color saturation for 

try shadergraph node algorithm for saturation and contrast

DONE :
saturation and contrast only on the skybox 
use vibration to give feedback on breathing.
make a discrete event for neutral expression
remove time from smile and pucker event
reward from 3 to 7 seconds
